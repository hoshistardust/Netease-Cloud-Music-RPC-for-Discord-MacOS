Scuffed Python code allowing the display of songs currently played with Netease Cloud Music on MacOS  
网易云音乐在Discord上显示正在播放的歌曲（MacOS)

## Setup
1. Create a new application on discord developer portal: https://discord.com/developers/applications.
2. Copy the application ID into the client_id field in the Python Script. Make sure you have the relevant libraries installed.
3. Run the script. (Needs to change the song once for it to show up)
